# Research-project-IMF-programmes
The code I wrote as a Research Assistant for dr. Saliha Metinsoy at the University of Groningen. 
One research project I contributed to was a panel analysis on the effect of IMF programmes. Here, we mostly used negative binomial GLMs, in which we had to account for selection bias. To do this, we made use of the GJRM package. The code for this can be found in the ProjectLaborCond.R file.

In another subproject, we investigated the trend of sentiment in IMF letters over time. I performed a sentiment analysis in R and the code for this can be found in the SentimentAnalysis folder.
